% notequal(X1, X2) holds true when X1 equals X2 and fails when X1 is not equal to X2

substitute(X, Y, [X|T], [Y|T]).  % Here, the head X of [X|T] is substituted by Y to yield the list with the head Y to produce the list [Y|T].  The tails of OLD and NEW are the same, because we seek to substitute only one occurrence.

substitute(X, Y, [H|T], [H|T1]):-

% moveblockblock(X, Y, Z, S1, S2) holds when a clear block X on block Y in state S1 is moved onto another clear block Z
