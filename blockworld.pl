% substitute (E, E1, OLD, NEW) holds when NEW is the list OLD in which E is substituted by E1.  There are no duplicates in OLD or NEW.
substitute(X, Y, [X|T], [Y|T]).  % Here, the head X of [X|T] is substituted by Y to yield the list with the head Y to produce the list [Y|T].  The tails of OLD and NEW are the same, because we seek to substitute only one occurrence.

substitute(X, Y, [H|T], [H|T1]):- 
    substitute(X, Y, T, T1).  % In this clause the element to be substituted is NOT the head of the list, so the head H of the list [H|T] carries over to the head H of the new list, but the tail of the new list is obtained from the tail T of the old list where the element X was substituted by Y, producing the new list [H|T1].

% move(X, Y, Z, S1, S2) holds when the state S2 is obtained from the state S1 
% by moving the block X from the block Y onto the block Z.
moveblockblock(X, Y, Z, S1, S2):-

% You must write two more rules for the blocksâ€™ world:

	append([[clear, Y]], INT, S2). % Y is now clear too

% (ii)	move X from the table onto a block
movetableblock(X, Z, S1, S2):- %move(X, "table", Z, S1, S2)
	member([clear, X], S1), %find a clear block X in S1
