% notequal(X1, X2) holds true when X1 equals X2 and fails when X1 is not equal to X2

% substitue(X, Y, [X|T], [Y|T]) holds when the head X of X|T is substiuted with Y to produce list Y|T where Y is the new head
% substitute (E, E1, OLD, NEW) holds when NEW is the list OLD in which E is substituted by E1.  There are no duplicates in OLD or NEW.
substitute(X, Y, [X|T], [Y|T]).  % Here, the head X of [X|T] is substituted by Y to yield the list with the head Y to produce the list [Y|T].  The tails of OLD and NEW are the same, because we seek to substitute only one occurrence.
